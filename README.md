# Dog-Image-Recognition
A python neural network project to predict the breeds of dog. The neural network is trained and fit with training data to predict and classify the testing data into different breeds of dog. 

This project uses a simple neural network provided by Tensorflow Hub without hidden layer to predict the breed of dog. The algorithm also utilizes early stopping to minimize the resources to train the model, log different versions of model, and predict breed labels of dog.
